            <div><p>The second performance of Abramović’s Rhythm Series is Rhythm 5, 
                which was performed in the Student Cultural Center in Belgrade in 1974. 
                In Rhythm 5, Abramović constructed a five-pointed communist star from wood and wood shavings, 
                hence the title Rhythm 5. She then soaked the star in 100 liters of petrol. 
                After setting fire to it, Abramović ceremoniously paced in a crucifixion pose, around the burning star. 
                She then proceeded to cut her hair, and as she paced repeatedly around the burning altar, she fed bunches of it 
                to each point of the star like a sacrificial offering. She followed this by then cutting her fingernails, 
                followed by her toenails, which she also scattered among the five corners of the star. Only after having repeatedly 
                circled the star and depositing her bodily offerings, does Abramović step into the star.
                As Abramović lay at the center of the burning star, the severity of the fire quickly absorbed the oxygen, 
                causing her to lose consciousness. Upon realizing Abramović was unconscious, two audience members intervened, 
                and removed her from the flames.</p></div>
            <div></div>
            <div><p>One of the first famous performances of Marina Abramovic, which became one of the most dangerous. 
                On the floor of the room, the young artist laid out a five-pointed star made of wood, doused it with oil and set it on fire. 
                First, she threw strands of her cut hair into the fire, and then went inside the structure and lay on the floor. 
                Abramovic was lying on her back, and the audience did not notice that she lost consciousness due to lack of air. 
                When the fire reached her leg, the audience realized that the artist did not feel anything, and carried her out of a burning star. 
                Subsequently, Abramovic said that she considered this performance to be unsuccessful since she overestimated her potential and went beyond 
                the boundaries of her physical capabilities. It cannot be allowed in art; otherwise, it loses its meaning.</p></div>

            <br>
            <div><p>The performance was an hour-and-a-half long. 
                When Abramovic entered the center of the star of burning flames the audience (which included Joseph Beuys) didn't quite 
                realize that Abramovic lost consciousness as the powerful flames sucked all the oxygen out of the air. 
                She was at last rescued when members of the audience pulled her, unconscious, from the fire. 
                While the performance and multi-faceted symbolism of the five-pointed star of Communism 
                (hence the title Rhythm 5) – also the pentagram of occultism – was a direct challenge to her parents, their politics and the state,
                 it was also a challenge to herself and the first of many such endurance-based works. 
                 “In this period, Abramovic focused on her body’s limits, making it both object and subject of the artistic action in which the 
                 artist pointed toward the literal and direct physical act on the body: in a behavioral sense, 
                 potential energy is transformed into mechanical, biochemical, sexual, psychological, and social energy.” 
                 (Biesenbach, 2010) </p>

            <div><br>"Rhythm 5 was about ritualization of the Communist five point star burning my hair, burning my nails.
                I had almost a serious accident because the fire took all the air, and when I was lying I lost consciousness. 
                And there was a doctor in the audience see that the small pieces of burning wood was falling on my neck and feet and I didn't react.
                So they took me out and then in that way interrupt the piece. And after Rhythm 5 I was so enormously mad that there is a limit with 
                performance and when you lose consciousness performance is not happening.", Marina has said about this performance.</br></div>

            <div><br>Abramović's family and cultural history has long influenced her performances: 
                a Yugoslavian native, her parents fought in favor of the communist party during World War II, while her grandparents' 
                generation were devout members of the Orthodox Church and vehemently opposed communism. This deeply ingrained familial conflict 
                fueled her Rhythms (1973-74) series, and the five-pointed communist star plays a central role in Rhythm 5.</i></br></div>
