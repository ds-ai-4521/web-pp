      <div>
        <p>"Balkan Baroque" by Marina Abramović is a deeply introspective and emotionally charged performance that
          delves into the artist's personal history and the complex socio-political landscape of the Balkans.</p>
      </div>
      <div></div>
      <div>
        <p>The use of cow bones in it serves as a powerful symbol. Abramović chose the bones to represent both the
          agricultural roots of the Balkans and the aftermath of the violent conflicts that plagued the region,
          particularly during the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. The repetitive act of cleaning the bones becomes a
          ritualistic and meditative process, reflecting the need for cleansing and reconciliation in the face of
          historical trauma.

      <br>
      <div>
        <p>As Abramović meticulously cleaned each bone, she recited stories and accounts from her own life, connecting
          personal experiences with the broader cultural and political context. The inclusion of her autobiography adds
          a layer of intimacy to the performance, inviting the audience to witness the artist's vulnerability and engage
          with the complexities of identity, memory, and resilience.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <img src="./balk5.jpg" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Slika balk5" width="440px">
      <br>
      <div><br>The piece was performed daily for a total of four days, each session lasting several hours. Abramović's
        endurance and commitment to the physically demanding task of cleaning each bone contributed to the visceral
        impact of the performance. The extended duration allowed for a profound immersion into the work, amplifying the
        emotional and psychological resonance for both the artist and the audience.</br></div>
      <br>
      <div>
        <p>Audience members were an integral part of the performance. They were invited to witness Abramović's actions
          up close, creating an intimate and participatory experience. The emotional weight of the stories shared,
          combined with the physicality of the bone-cleaning process, had a profound impact on the viewers, eliciting a
          range of emotions from empathy to discomfort.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div>
        <p>It is considered one of Marina Abramović's seminal works, showcasing her ability to blend personal narrative
          with broader social and political themes. The piece has left a lasting impact on the contemporary art scene,
          prompting discussions about the role of performance art in addressing historical traumas and the ways in which
          artists can navigate their own cultural and political identities.</p>

      <br>
      <div>
        <p>While the live performances of "Balkan Baroque" were ephemeral, the piece has been documented through
          photographs and video recordings. These archival materials contribute to the ongoing legacy of the work,
          allowing audiences to engage with its themes and Abramović's powerful presence even after the original
          performances have concluded.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div>
        <p>"Balkan Baroque" stands as a testament to Marina Abramović's ability to use her body and personal experiences
          as a canvas for exploring broader societal issues, leaving a lasting imprint on the history of performance
          art.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div>
        <p>The piece also shares a name with the 1999 documentary, which serves as a biographical look into Abramović's
          life. The film composes the life aesthetic of a woman in her era, with a personal history strongly marked by
          the Yugoslavia of Tito, everyday violence, the experience of physical and psychic limits.</p>
