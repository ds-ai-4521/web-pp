            <div><p>In their 1977 performance, Imponderabilia, Abramović and Ulay stood as human doorposts on either side of the narrow entrance 
                to the Galleria Communale d’Arte Moderna, in Bologna, Italy. 
                The narrowness of the space forced visitors to squeeze sideways between them, 
                forced to choose whether to face the naked Ulay or naked Abramović in order to enter the museum. 
                Upon viewing the filmed footage from this performance, one notes that what stands out the most in this piece is not the 
                vulnerability of the two naked artists, but rather the vulnerability and uncertainty of the visitors. 
                Each person, upon reaching the entrance, was forced to decide first, whether they would enter the museum, and next, 
                whether they would face the naked Abramović or the naked Ulay. By placing these decisions in the hands of the viewer, 
                Imponderabilia becomes a performance of reflection on the subsequent reactions and interactions of the spectators. 
                This piece also reflects Abramović and Ulay’s shared interest in duration, as the piece was performed in shifts, 
                repeated throughout the exhibition, for a total of 700 hours.</p></div>
            <div></div>
            <div><p>We are standing naked in the main entrance of the museum, facing each other. 
                In 1976 Abramović met Ulay, and over the next decade they collaborated in a series of relational performances during which 
                they referred to themselves as a collective, androgynous being called “Ulay-Abramović.” 
                In these works Abramović and Ulay questioned the socially defined identities of both femininity and masculinity, 
                while also continuing to test their limits. These performances by Abramović and Ulay were not meant to be pleasing spectacles, 
                but rather to disturb the viewer from a role of passivity.The public entering the Museum has to pass sideways through the small 
                space between us. 


                Each person passing has to choose which one of us to face', 
                says Abramovic at the start of the compilation version of the performance registration. 
                The artists' bodies together form the entrance to the Galleria Communale d'Arte Moderna in Bologna, Italy, 
                which visitors must pass if they wish to gain access to the museum. When the visitors become aware that physical 
                contact with the naked Abramovic and Ulay is inevitable and they will have to make a choice between the woman and the man, 
                they at least try to avoid eye contact. Once the visitors are inside the museum, they realized that they had beenfilmed by 
                a hidden camera. Moreover, they were confronted with a text on the wall: 'Imponderable. 
                Such imponderable human factors as one's aesthetic sensitivity / the overriding importance of imponderables in determining 
                human conduct.' The text refers directly to the visitor's behaviour on entry. Indeed, what this performance actually revolves 
                around is the reaction provoked in the visitors when they enter the gallery. After 90 minutes, the police put an end to this 
                controversial performance, which had actually been intended to last for three hours..

            <div><br>Imponderabilia surveys the symbiotic dynamic between male and female. 
                Created in collaboration with Ulay, the performance serves as a form of disturbance for the viewer 
                from the role of a passive spectator. In this relational piece, Abramović and Ulay challenge the socially defined identities 
                of both femininity and masculinity, while also continuing to test their physiological limits. Spectators at the Galleria Communale
                d'Arte Moderna were forced to squeeze through the two artists’ naked bodies that flanked the entrance to the exhibition, and choose
                whether they wanted to face the male or female body. Although nudity is common throughout many of Abramovic’s performances, 
                Imponderabilia presents the audience with a deviation of personas, provoking a public reaction riddled with uneasiness and hesitancy.
                Remarkably, the subjection of the two naked artists is overshadowed by the vulnerability and uncertainty of the spectators. 
                The characteristic of vulnerability that normally accompanies the persona of a nude figure has been transferred completely to the 
                clothed audience members passing between Abramovic and Ulay. Imponderabilia therefore becomes a reflection on the subsequent reactions
                and interactions of the audience, which is fundamental to the rationale of the performance.</br></div>

            <div><br>Artsy explored the historical significance of "Imponderabilia" within the context of Abramović's career. 
                The review highlighted the piece as a symbol of the artist's dedication to exploring the relationship between the performer 
                and the audience.

                It's important to note that opinions on Abramović's work, including "Imponderabilia," can vary widely, 
                with some praising the provocative nature of her performances, while others may find them challenging or controversial. 
                Overall, the piece is recognized as a seminal work that has left a lasting impact on the field of performance art. </i></br></div>
