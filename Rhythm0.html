            <div><p>The life threatening performance of Rhythm 0 featured Marina
                Abramovic, completely vulnerable to the will of her audience for 
                six hours. The participators were given an array (seventy-two) of 
                items to utilize and do with as they please without any 
                repercussions, such objects ranged from a polaroid camera to a
                gun and a single bullet. Displaying the horrendous actions people
                were willing to inflict upon another just because they have been
                given the permission her constant focus on pushing the body’s 
                physical and emotional limits continues in this piece. People
                pricked her with rose thorns, removed her clothing, whipped 
                her and dried her involuntary tears with tissues. 
                One went as far as loading the gun with the bullet and 
                placing it to the side of her head, manipulating her fingers
                against the trigger to see if she would respond.  By the end 
                of the performance she had been stripped naked and bleeding,
                with miscellaneous fragments littered over her body. At the 
                exact six hour mark, unbeknownst to them, she began to walk 
                towards the audience, which had increased exponentially since
                the beginning of the performance. Desperate to escape 
                confrontation, nearly every spectator, whether they had 
                interacted with Abramović or not, fled immediately from 
                the space.</p></div>
            <div></div>
            <div><p>Through this piece, the artist was able to subconsciously 
                expose the true human nature of the audience. The artist 
                established an anonymous atmosphere where people could freely
                act upon instinct with no fear of reciprocation, giving them 
                a false sense of security. Then, the second she broke the illusion
                of their anonymity, reintroducing the fact that she was conscious
                of their actions, reality sets in and fear replaces freedom.  
                Because without fear of judgement, of reciprocation or 
                consequence, human nature degenerates to a point of volatility.</p></div>

            <div><p>It began tamely. Someone turned her around. Someone thrust
                her arms into the air. Someone touched her somewhat intimately.
                The Neapolitan night began to heat up. In the third hour all her
                clothes were cut from her with razor blades. In the fourth hour
                the same blades began to explore her skin. Her throat was slashed 
                so someone could suck her blood. Various minor sexual assaults 
                were carried out on her body. She was so committed to the piece 
                that she would not have resisted rape or murder. Faced with her 
                abdication of will, with its implied collapse of human psychology, 
                a protective group began to define itself in the audience. When a 
                loaded gun was thrust to Marina's head and her own finger was 
                being worked around the trigger, a fight broke out between the 
                audience factions."</p>
