                <p>"The Artist is Present" is a notable performance art piece by Marina Abramović, and it was also the
                    title of a documentary that captures the artist's retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)
                    in New York in 2010.</p>

                <p>In aformentioned art piece, Marina Abramović sat in the museum's atrium for a total of 736 hours over
                    the course of three months. Visitors to the museum were invited to sit across from her at a table
                    and share a silent gaze. The performance was a powerful exploration of the connection between the
                    artist and the audience, as well as an endurance test for Abramović herself.

                    from her.
